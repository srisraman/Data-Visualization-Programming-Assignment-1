# Data-Visualization-Programming-Assignment-1

The data set provided deals with world temperatures and comes from NASA: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.  The chart shows the GISTEMP for the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, and the globe through all the given years.  The x-axis is the years and the y-axis is the deviation. Prior to plotting the chart, I restricted the dat set to have just four variables - Year, Globe, NHem, and SHem.  The chart was drawn in R with ggplot2 package.  The code is also available in the repo.  

The green line is the data for northern hemisphere, red for the globe, and blue for the southern hemisphere. The chart clearly shows an increasing trend in mean global temperatures for the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, and the globe.  Temperatures in the northern hemisphere are higher than the temperatures in the southern hemisphere.
